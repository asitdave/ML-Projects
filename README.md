# Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to my machine learning projects repository! This portfolio contains a series of hands-on projects designed to demonstrate various machine learning techniques, algorithms, and workflows. Each project explores different aspects of data science, from data cleaning and preprocessing to model training and evaluation.


## Recent Project

[Regression: Housing Price Prediction](./Regression/Project-1)


- **Objective**: Predict the housing prices based on various features such as area, number of bedrooms, amenities, etc.

- **Techniques**:

	-   Data preprocessing and cleaning
	-	Feature engineering
	-	Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor
	-	Model evaluation using MSE, R² score, etc.

- **Tools & Libraries**:
	-	Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn

## Future Projects

This repository will continue to grow as I add more machine learning projects. Here are the general areas that will be covered:

-   Supervised Learning: Classification and Regression problems
-	Unsupervised Learning: Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction
-	Deep Learning: Neural Networks and Computer Vision
